## 🎯 What Is This?

A comprehensive cost calculator that provides **Year 1 Total Cost of Ownership** estimates for agentic AI implementations across four major platforms:

- 🤖 **UiPath** - Agent Builder + Orchestrator
- 🔷 **Microsoft Copilot Studio** + AI Studio
- 🔵 **ServiceNow** - Now Assist
- 🟠 **Databricks** - Model Serving

**Calculates two cost dimensions:**
1. **Implementation Costs** (one-time development)
2. **Runtime Costs** (ongoing operational expenses)

---

## 📊 Quick Example

**Medium Invoice Processing Agent on Microsoft Copilot Studio:**

**Inputs:**
- T-Shirt Size: Medium (M)
- Agents: 2
- Tools: 3
- Monthly Requests: 50,000
- Risk Factors: HITL + First-Time Team

**Output:**
- **Implementation**: $65,800 (47 days)
- **Annual Runtime**: $24,000
- **Year 1 TCO**: $89,800

## 🏗️ Architecture

### T-Shirt Sizing Framework

| Size | Complexity Score | Base Days | Example |
|------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| **S** | 4-10 | 18 days | FAQ bot |
| **M** | 11-18 | 34 days | Invoice processor |
| **L** | 19-25 | 55 days | Contract analyzer |
| **XL** | 26-32 | 86 days | Autonomous operations |

### TCO Formula

```
Year 1 TCO = Implementation + Runtime

Implementation = Base Days × Daily Rate × Risk Multipliers
Runtime = Platform Licenses + API Costs + Infrastructure
```

### Platform Comparison (Medium Project)

| Platform | Year 1 TCO | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Databricks** | $67K | Data-heavy use cases |
| **MS Copilot** | $72K | M365 ecosystems |
| **ServiceNow** | $86K | ITSM integration |
| **UiPath** | $95K | RPA transition |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is implementation cost the same across platforms?**  
A: Development effort is platform-independent. Runtime costs vary due to licensing.

**Q: Can I customize for my organization?**  
A: Yes! Fork the repo and adjust daily rates, token costs, or platform pricing.

**Q: How often is pricing updated?**  
A: Quarterly. Last update: October 2024. Next: January 2025.

**Q: What if my project is between sizes?**  
A: Use complexity scoring to fine-tune, or split the difference.

**Q: Does this replace detailed planning?**  
A: No - use for early scoping. Detailed planning comes after requirements.
